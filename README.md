8)	Customer Loan Defaulting  
This project is an attempt to forecast how we can decrease loan defaults of Personal Loans. I built a model for this loan prediction. This problem would be interesting to solve because it's existing problem in loan business and eventually by predicting the defaulter, it could be beneficial to the lending organization. This prediction might help any bank to be prepared for any foreseen pandemics in future.

9)	Customer Personality Analysis
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers and it also helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments.

My Research question: Is it possible for a company to develop its business by researching the personality of its ideal customers?

#About Me.

I am Sharath Chandra Tummanapally. I work as a Scrum Master in Discover Financial Services. I live in Wheeling, Illinois. I am married and recently blessed with a beautiful angel. With more than 13 years of experience in IT, I was involved in software development projects for various global banks. 
 
With my experience in banking systems of these various banks and the huge data involved, I have always been passionate about the data. Also, I have always enjoyed problem-solving and statistical analysis, which led my interest in data science. It was a big step but with the support of my family, I decided to take the program in Masters of Data Science.
